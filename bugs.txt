- Flights that do not exist should warn the client, not return 0 seats available. (just return -1)
- After crashing, resource managers load up as Null, therefore they cannot load the correct record or hashtable
- Bug from part 2 (???)
- using a MW crashpoint throws a strace to the client after MW crashses (maybe an okay bug, but supressing seems good)
- crashpoint recovery errors (straces in client and MW). commands to reproduce:
	- crash,MW,0
	- start
	- newcustomer,1
	- commit,1
(unexpected message in log)
