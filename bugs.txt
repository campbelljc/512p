- Flights that do not exist should warn the client, not return 0 seats available. (just return -1)
- After crashing, resource managers load up as Null, therefore they cannot load the correct record or hashtable
- Bug from part 2 (???)
- using a MW crashpoint throws a strace to the client after MW crashses (not a huge deal, but ideally we would catch this error and print a simple error message)
- We cannot recover, because we do not save the updates made by the transaction.
