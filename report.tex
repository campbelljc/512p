\section{Web Services}

The middleware service was positioned between the client and resource manager (RM) servers. It receives requests from the client, determines the nature of the request, and forwards the request to the relevant resource manager server. It is also responsible for processing all operations related to customer data, communicating if necessary with the server depending on the operation (e.g. for the deleteCustomer or reserve methods).

Implementation - The middleware was put into a new package.

\section{TCP}
